# Weather-Driven-Wikipedia-Content-Explorer

## Description

This application combines weather data for a chosen city and information about the weather conditions in one convenient place.

It was developed by Isaac Fallon, Zac Gilfoyle, Soni Poudel and Alex da Silva.

Our motivation to develop this application came from wanting users to learn about about possible weather conditions. Especially because they can be unpredictable and global warming is always a topic of conversation.

Technologies used to create the project include: GitHub, Bulma CSS Framework, Wikipedia API, OpenWeather API, DayJS.
